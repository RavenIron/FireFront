    /// silent failure, no damage ever observed (likely gated behind
    /// Character's internal heat-accumulation threshold). v2 (this file's

    /// collision matrix. This version polls explicitly instead, which bypasses
    /// that matrix entirely — Physics.OverlapSphere only cares about the
    /// LayerMask parameter, not the pairwise collision matrix that governs
