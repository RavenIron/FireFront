# FireFront — session handoff (updated 2026-09-03)

Resume point for the next working session. Read this before touching anything;
the memory notes in the assistant's store point here.

## Where everything stands

- **Repo**: `main` at **0.19.14**, pushed to github.com/RavenIron/FireFront,
  every version tagged through `v0.19.14`. GitHub releases published for
  v0.19.8, v0.19.9, v0.19.11 and v0.19.14 (each with the bare DLL and the
  mod-manager zip attached, SHA256s in the notes).
- **Deployed builds: 0.19.14 everywhere** — the test server, the Steam
  install, and all four Gale profiles. Verified by reading the assembly
  version, not by hashing (a rebuild changes the hash for identical source)
  and not by grepping the DLL for version-shaped strings (FireFront's own log
  text contains literals like `0.17.2`, so a grep returns a list, not an
  answer). Use `[System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo]::GetVersionInfo(path)`
  or read the boot log line.
- **The owner plays the `Default` Gale profile**, not `raveniron`. See the
  operational note below — a whole session's client deploys once went to the
  wrong profile.
- **Config defaults only reach installs that never ran an older build.**
  BepInEx persists values to disk, so changing a default in code does nothing
  where the key is already written. This bit twice in one day: 0.19.13's new
  `SmoulderAfterFraction` of 0.65 was silently overridden by the 0.45 that
  0.19.12 had written. Set it explicitly on existing installs.
- **Testers**: at least one is on **0.19.3** (their log proved it), others may
  still be on the **0.18.0** Discord zip. Everything they are missing is in
  the v0.19.14 release.
  **Owner's call 2026-08-28: no Discord post needed** — the regenerated split
  in `dist\DISCORD_POST_READY.txt` exists but is not to be shipped unless the
  owner asks.
## In flight — finish these first

1. ~~**Relay verification, 3 of 5 commands outstanding.**~~ **DONE 2026-08-28
   — ALL FIVE RELAYABLE COMMANDS VERIFIED END-TO-END at 0.19.2 both sides.**
   `firestatus` and `firetreeregrowlist` were green on 0.19.0;
   `firegroundignite`, `startfire 10`, `clearfires` verified live today: zero
   "Admin only." refusals, `[RELAY] <cmd> from peer -428794145` on the server
   for each, and the matching `[server] ...` reply in the client log
   (`Seeded ground fire...`, `startfire: attempted 0 targets within 10m`,
   and `All fires cleared.` after clearing 8 entries). That "0 targets" was
   NOT harmless staging ground — it exposed a real bug, fixed in 0.19.3:
   startfire's target scan was still instance-only (AllPieces +
   FindObjectsOfType), which see nothing headless — the 0.17.4 root cause,
   never converted for this command. It now also sweeps the ZDO layer via
   `FireManager.IgniteBurnablesNear` (own scratch list — never clobbers the
   spread cycle's `_zdoCandidates` cache). **VERIFIED LIVE same day after a
   server bounce (0.19.3 both sides, load lines confirmed):** relayed
   `startfire 10` near real trees answered `attempted 3 targets within 10m`
   and the next heartbeat showed `burning 3/50` — three real fires on the
   headless server where the identical command had found zero. The
   doubled startfire in the server log was the owner running it twice (two
   separate client "sent to server" lines), not a double-send. The 0.19.1
   relay-before-local-gate fix is proven. Historical root cause kept for the
   record: vanilla's client-side `PlayerIsAdmin` exact-string match never
   matches a crossplay `Steam_7656...` id against a bare adminlist entry;
   the optional adminlist append (`Steam_76561198392625778`) remains a
   nice-to-have for vanilla's own commands, nothing of ours needs it.
2. ~~**Duplicate tree-regrowth entries.**~~ **DONE in 0.19.2 (2026-08-28):**
   position-keyed dedupe (`EnqueueRegrowth`, 0.5m radius, existing entry wins —
   its attempt count is real history) guards BOTH enqueue sites in
   `Fire/FireManager.cs` (burn-down and sidecar restore; a pre-fix sidecar can
   itself hold duplicates, and a deduped restore entry now counts as skipped,
   not restored). Builds clean; in-game verification pending — rerun
   `firetreeregrowlist` after the next burn and look for the
   `Regrowth dedupe:` debug line or simply no double entries.
3. **Ship to testers** — ON HOLD, owner said no Discord post needed
   (2026-08-28). The zip stays ready in dist\ if that changes.

4. ~~**The tester frametime spike.**~~ **DIAGNOSED AND FIXED — one measurement
   still outstanding.** Resolved from the tester's own Player.log, and the
   guesswork it replaced is worth remembering:
   - They run **0.19.3, hosting** (`IsServer=True`) — NOT the 0.18.0 zip. The
     earlier "they're just on an old build" theory was WRONG; they already had
     every prior performance fix, which is why the spike survived them.
   - Their log: `total candidates (pieces+trees+logs)=2176` (only 131 of them
     pieces), `burning 50/50, queued 20/20, ground 46/50`. `SpreadPass`
     compared every candidate to every burner each 0.75s cycle — roughly a
     quarter of a million distance checks per cycle, each carrying a type
     dispatch and a ZDO lookup. Measured spikes: 101.9-146.3ms. The arithmetic
     lands exactly on the symptom.
   - **0.19.8** put both candidate lists in a 16m spatial grid so a burner only
     examines the cells its reach touches; **0.19.5** had already cut ~5x by
     moving trees out of the instance list. VERIFIED, and then stress-proven:
     `burntheworld` ran **1316 burning objects and 6500 ground cells across 13
     fires on one saturated core**. The pre-0.19.8 code would have needed ~2.6
     MILLION checks per cycle for that — the configuration is only reachable
     because of the grid.
   - **0.19.12-14** then attacked the OTHER half. The tester's spike was worse
     *looking toward* the fire than away from it, i.e. rendering, not
     simulation — and every burning object carried its own realtime Light for
     its whole burn. Fires now drop to embers, glow and intermittent flare-ups
     past `SmoulderAfterFraction`. Confirmed by eye ("that reads better") after
     a first attempt that read as "the fire went out".

   **STILL OUTSTANDING — the only real gap left: nobody has MEASURED whether
   smouldering buys frames.** It shipped on a sound argument and the owner's
   visual approval, not a number. CapFrameX is installed on the owner's box and
   both toggles are live commands, so it is two captures with no restart:
   `fireset smouldering false` -> capture 60s at a burn -> `fireset smouldering
   true` -> capture the same spot. Compare P1/P0.2 lows and max frametime. That
   number is what tells the tester whether their problem is actually solved —
   and if it does NOT help, the next suspects are the ground damage-zone
   objects and the felled physics logs, not the particles.

5. **Dedicated FireFront test server — USE THIS, not the Steam install.**
   `C:\Users\donfr\FireFrontTestServer` (created 2026-08-29): a full copy of
   the dedicated server stripped to TWO plugins, FireFront and Server
   Devcommands, with its own `ff-test.log`. Port **2458** so it never collides
   with Ravenrest on 2456.
   WHY it exists: the Steam server install is now the live Ravenrest modpack
   (26 plugins). Two servers sharing that install share one FireFront.dll — so
   a test server could not run a different build than Ravenrest — and its
   mandatory-mod list (Jotunn, Seasonality, VikingOS, WardIsLove...) rejected
   the owner's client with "incompatible version" every time. A minimal server
   demands nothing of a client and restores the property CLAUDE.md asks for:
   a failure there is unambiguously ours. Ravenrest's install is untouched;
   do not stop Ravenrest without asking.

   **START AND STOP IT WITH THE SCRIPTS IN `tools\`, NOT BY HAND:**
   ```powershell
   .\tools\start-test-server.ps1     # prints the join code; password 'firetest'
   .\tools\stop-test-server.ps1      # graceful, and VERIFIES the save
   ```
   Both take `-ServerDir` if the install ever moves. Copies also live in the
   server directory itself.

   **Why they exist, which is the important part.** The original CTRL_BREAK
   helper lived in a session scratchpad that got cleaned between sessions.
   Every "graceful stop" after that was launching PowerShell against a file
   that no longer existed, failing SILENTLY, timing out, and falling through to
   a force-kill — which skips Valheim's shutdown save. It only failed
   harmlessly because nobody was connected at the time. So:
   - `stop-test-server.ps1` fails LOUDLY (a distinct message per failure mode)
     and confirms "World saved" **from the log**, never from a file mtime —
     mtime races the write and already produced one false "it didn't save"
     alarm. It refuses to force-kill unless given `-AllowForceKill`.
   - `start-test-server.ps1` passes **no `-RedirectStandardOutput`** (Unity's
     `-logfile` already captures everything, and the redirect can leave the
     process with no console for CTRL_BREAK to attach to) and **refuses to
     start a second instance** — double-starting on one port happened twice in
     one session, and the loser lingers without binding.
   - `_ctrlbreak-helper.ps1` returns meaningful exit codes. NOTE exit
     `-1073741510` (STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT) is the SUCCESS case: the helper
     attaches to the target's console, so the break it raises kills the helper
     too. It looks like a failure and is proof of delivery.

   Test-server state as of 2026-09-03: FireFront 0.19.14, `BurnDurationSeconds`
   240, `SmoulderAfterFraction` 0.65, smouldering on, both presets off, debug
   logging off. Password `firetest` (changed from `secret` after a client-side
   cached-password rejection).
6. **Tester's other observation, unexamined: fire prods physics hard.** They
   reported lag on a scale they had not seen in ~7k hours of Valheim, needing
   three people to cut up a bonfire to recover, and thought they had a
   screenshot. Plausible mechanism: felled trees spawn physics logs via
   vanilla's own felling and are UNCAPPED by design, while ground fire also
   creates damage-zone objects (`GroundDamageMaxConcurrent` caps those).
   Ask them for the screenshot or a clip — a visible log pile in frame would
   distinguish physics objects from particle cost immediately, and the two have
   different fixes.


## Operational facts that cost real time — do not relearn

- **The owner plays on the `Default` Gale profile, NOT `raveniron`.**
  Corrected 2026-08-29: an earlier note here said `raveniron`, and a whole
  session's client deploys went to the wrong profile before the mistake
  showed up (it was masked because every profile ended up byte-identical
  anyway — SHA256-checked). `Default` is the one whose config file gets
  written during play; it carries FireFront, Undertow, LetItGrow, Jotunn and
  ConfigurationManager. `raveniron` (FireFront + Ragnarok's Wrath + Server
  Devcommands) matches the dedicated server's plugin set. When in doubt, the
  profile whose `BepInEx\config\com.raveniron.firefront.cfg` has the newest
  mtime is the one that was just played.
- **Client deploys go through Gale, never hand-copies to
  `plugins\FireFront\`.** A hand-copied folder next to Gale's managed
  `RavenIronStudios-FireFront\` folder means two DLLs with one GUID and
  BepInEx loads whichever it finds first — this caused days of "wrong version
  loaded" chaos. Correct paths: Gale cache
  `%APPDATA%\com.kesomannen.gale\cache\RavenIronStudios-FireFront\<ver>\` and
  profile `...\profiles\<profile>\BepInEx\plugins\RavenIronStudios-FireFront\`.
  Gale's enable/disable state lives in its SQLite db (`data.sqlite3`) — don't
  edit it; worst case the user clicks enable in Gale's UI. `.old` suffixes on
  files = Gale's "disabled" convention.
- **Deploy ritual**: build Release → stop server (`Stop-Process`) → copy DLL
  to server + Gale profile (profile copy needs the game CLOSED; arm an
  until-loop background copy if it isn't) → restart server → verify by log
  strings ("All 8 FireFront RPCs", version line), never by trusting the copy.
- **Console commands run where typed.** `fireset`/`firestatus` and the five
  relayables forward to the server themselves since 0.18.3/0.18.8/0.19.0;
  `ignite`/`stopfire` forward by ZDOID (crosshair is local). Anything new that
  touches server state joins the `_relayable` whitelist in
  `Commands/FireDevCommands.cs` and inherits relay + server-side auth.
- **Server log**: `AppendLog = true` (accumulates across launches — slice from
  the LAST "Preloader started"). BepInEx header timestamps are unreliable;
  date by Unity log lines or mtime. Heartbeat every 15s while fire burns is
  the server's pulse; debug logging (`DebugLogging`, renamed from
  VerboseLogging in 0.18.7) is OFF by default and free when off.
- **The publicized DLL lies about visibility.** Compile-time public ≠ runtime
  public (`ObjectDB.m_itemByHash`, `ZNet` members). Reflect vanilla members,
  verify shapes with `ilspycmd` against `libs\assembly_valheim_publicized.dll`,
  and read the decompiled BODY, not the signature.
- **ffmpeg** is installed (winget, Gyan.FFmpeg) for analyzing tester clips;
  the Linux tester runs MangoHud under Proton — frametime-graph clips are
  gold, ask for them.

## Architecture landmarks from this arc (0.17.2 → 0.19.14)

Wind-strength-scaled spread; igniter attribution; ZDO-layer spread candidates
(instance scans see NOTHING headless — proven) with a 5s candidate cache;
Dousing Bomb (BombOoze clone, no Jotunn); fire persistence sidecar next to the
world save (remaining-seconds encoding, `_restoredRampAge` for the −1
sentinel); reconnect re-registration (ZRoutedRpc is per-connection — guard by
instance reference); BurnPlayerBuildings (creator-stamp gate, ZDO-readable);
douse immunity (extinguished = soaked 90s); spread maturity (front pace tied
to burn time — user-confirmed tuned); allocation-free debug logging
(interpolated-string handler, net472 attribute polyfill); generic command
relay (whitelist + server-side `PeerIsAdmin` + peer refPos standing in for
"local player").

All of it field-verified on the live dedicated server; the changelog carries
the evidence per version.
