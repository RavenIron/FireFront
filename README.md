🔥 **FireFront — Tester Build v0.19.8**

Fire that actually spreads. Torch a wall and it can take the whole build with it, jump to the treeline, and crawl across open ground to get there — not just "this one piece is on fire," an actual moving front.

**Requires:** BepInEx (you already have this if you're testing Valheim mods)

**Install:** drop `FireFront.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`, launch, done. No config needed to just play — everything below is for people who want to poke at it. On a dedicated server, the server needs the dll too (it runs the actual fire; your client just shows it to you).

**What it does**
• Structures, standing trees, and felled logs can all catch fire and burn down for real — with real drops (trees fell via vanilla's own felling and leave logs, logs leave wood)
• Fire spreads to nearby burnable stuff, structure-to-structure, tree-to-tree, or structure-to-tree
• **Big fix in 0.17.4: forest spread now actually works on dedicated servers.** It turns out tree-to-tree and ground-to-tree spread had *never* worked on a dedicated server (fine in single-player) — the server literally couldn't see trees. If you tested on a server before and thought fire seemed weirdly tame, that was this. Burn a forest and see the difference.
• Fire also spreads across open ground/grass between things too far apart to ignite each other directly — you can *see* it crawling through grass as small ember flickers
• Standing in fire hurts, players and mobs alike — same mechanism vanilla campfires use
• **New: fire follows the wind.** The front stretches downwind and thins out upwind, using the game's real wind — and how *hard* it's blowing matters now too. A gale drives a long narrow tongue of fire; a calm day burns in a lazy, even circle. Watch a fire when the weather turns.
• Fires start small and ramp up over ~10 minutes instead of instantly raging
• **New in 0.18.5: fire spreads at the pace of its fuel.** A burning tree has to be properly alight (~a minute in) before it starts torching neighbors and dropping fire to the ground — no more front teleporting through a forest faster than anything actually burns. Tune with `fireset firematurity` (0 = old instant spread)
• **Fixed in 0.18.6/0.18.7: the periodic stutter during big fires is gone.** A tester clip (thank you — frametime graphs are gold) showed regular frame spikes every few seconds while a forest burned. Both feeders are dead: a periodic bookkeeping scan and debug logging that built its strings even when switched off. If big fires used to hiccup for you, try your worst on this build
• Rain douses grass fire (an already-burning building keeps going)
• Burned ground is spent — it can't relight for ~90s, so the front *advances* instead of churning in place, and it leaves burn scars behind
• Dirt paths and cultivated ground are real firebreaks; water stops spread too. **This protects your base more than you'd expect**: the leveled/pathed ground most bases sit on counts as fuel-free, so a wildfire will burn right up to the edge of your yard and stall there — your walls only catch if fire starts *inside* the perimeter (or you clear less ground). If it looks like "fire can't touch my buildings," it's actually your groundwork doing its job — keep a tended break around your base and it genuinely works, exactly like real firefighting
• Ground fire won't wander more than ~40m from where the fire started
• Burned trees regrow after ~15 minutes if the spot's still clear
• Press **G** to extinguish what you're looking at plus all fire around you — ground fire *and* burning structures/trees
• **New in 0.17.5: the Dousing Bomb.** A throwable that puts fire OUT — everything within ~6m of where it lands, grass fire and burning buildings/trees alike. Hand-craftable anywhere, cheap on purpose: 3 Resin + 2 Leather scraps makes 3 bombs. (It borrows the ooze bomb's look for now — yes, the fire extinguisher is green. Art later, function first.) Fight a fire for real instead of just G-spamming next to it.
• **Better in 0.18.4: dousing sticks.** Everything you extinguish is *soaked* for ~90s and can't re-light, so a line of bombs cuts a real firebreak ahead of the front instead of the fire instantly refilling the hole. Big fires are now genuinely fightable — get ahead of the front and cut it off, like actual wildfire crews do
• Fires now remember who lit them — the whole spreading front carries its arsonist, even fire that crawled a long way from the first spark (natural/creature fire belongs to nobody). Nothing visible in-game yet; it feeds a companion mod's reputation system
• **New in 0.18.0: fires survive server restarts.** Burning stuff comes back burning with its remaining time, burned-out ground stays spent, and trees waiting to regrow still regrow — a reboot no longer resets the world's fire state
• **New in 0.18.2: server owners can make player builds fireproof.** `fireset burnbuildings false` (or the `BurnPlayerBuildings` config) means fire never ignites anything a player placed — not by spread, not by fire arrows, not by anything — while ruins and world structures still burn. The anti-grief switch, for servers that want wildfires without arson
• **New in 0.19.0: every command works from anywhere.** `firestatus`, `startfire`, `clearfires` and friends used to refuse or answer wrong unless you typed them on the server itself — now they run on the server no matter where you type them (checked against the server's own admin list) and the output comes back to your console as `[server] ...`
• Everything's config-tunable and adjustable live via console — no restart needed

**Heads-up if updating from an older build:** update server and client together — a mixed-version pair (0.17.3 with anything older) means clicking `ignite` from a client silently does nothing.

**Struggling machine? Try `fireset lowspec true`**
New in 0.19.6, and the first thing to reach for if big fires cost you frames. One switch: fewer things burning at once, fewer fire visuals, no scorch decals, and a slower spread tick. Fire still spreads and still burns your base down — there's just less happening simultaneously. It doesn't touch your own settings (anything you've already set lower is kept, and turning it off puts everything back), and `firestatus` shows you exactly what's in force. Also settable as `LowSpecPreset` in the config file if you'd rather not use the console.

If you've been running an older build and big fires stuttered, **update first** — 0.18.6, 0.18.7 and 0.19.5 each removed a separate cause of that, and the newest one cut out a full-scene scan whose cost grew with how much stuff was lying around your world.

**What to expect / known limits**
• The fire visual is homemade, not a vanilla asset — it'll look like fire, just not *exactly* like Valheim's own fire
• Default settings are tuned aggressive for testing — expect fire to spread fast and hungrily unless you dial it down yourself

**Useful console commands** (` key to open console)
```
firestatus              — see what's currently burning + all current settings
ignite                  — ignite whatever's under your crosshair
startfire [radius]      — ignite everything burnable within radius of you
stopfire                — extinguish whatever's under your crosshair
clearfires              — nuke every active fire instantly
firedebug               — toggle verbose fire logging
fireset <key> <value>   — live-tune settings, no restart needed (applies on the server no matter where you type it)
```
Full list of tunable `fireset` keys: `burnduration`, `firematurity`, `spreadradius`, `maxburning`, `queuesize`, `spreadinterval`, `trees`, `burnbuildings`, `vfx`, `procedural`, `groundenabled`, `groundcellsize`, `groundradius`, `groundburnduration`, `groundmax`, `groundvfxmax`, `grounddamagemax`, `firehurts`, `firehurtsplayeronly`, `firehurtsradius`, `firedamage`, `firetickinterval`, `extinguishradius`, `douseimmunity`, `rainsuppress`, `rainmultiplier`, `scorchmarks`, `scorchlifetime`, `dirtpaint`, `dirtpaintradius`, `rampenabled`, `rampduration`, `rampstart`, `exhaustionenabled`, `fuelregrow`, `windbias`, `windupwindchance`, `windinfluence`, `dousingradius`, `persistfires`, `firebreaks`, `treeregrowth`, `treeregrowthseconds`, `groundleashenabled`, `groundleashdistance`, `lowspec`, `enabled`

Wind ones worth playing with: `fireset windinfluence 0` ignores wind entirely (old-style even spread), `1` is full effect (the default). `firestatus` shows the live wind strength the fire is currently feeling.

There are a few more diagnostic-only commands (`firelistprefabs`, `firecheckprefab`, `firepurgevfx`, `firegroundignite`, `firetreeregrow`, `firetreeregrowlist`) mostly meant for dev-side debugging — ask in here if you're curious what they do.

**If something breaks**
Please grab your `LogOutput.log` (BepInEx folder) and send it over, especially if you see a wall of red repeating errors. Screenshots of weird spread behavior are also genuinely useful — "this jumped way further than it should have" is easier to diagnose with a picture than a description. For wind specifically: a screenshot of a burn scar plus which way the wind was blowing is exactly the evidence we need.

Thanks for testing — this thing has had a real rough-and-tumble development process (ask if you want the story), so any weirdness you catch now saves everyone a headache later.
