# Starts the FireFront test server. Pairs with stop-test-server.ps1.
#
# The test server is a SEPARATE INSTALL, not the Steam one — see docs/HANDOFF.md.
# The Steam install is the owner's live Ravenrest modpack: two servers there
# share one FireFront.dll (so a test build could not differ from Ravenrest's)
# and its mandatory-mod list rejects a plain client with "incompatible version".
#
# Two deliberate choices, both learned the hard way:
#
#  1. NO -RedirectStandardOutput. Unity's own -logfile captures everything, and
#     redirecting stdout can leave the process without an attachable console —
#     exactly what stop-test-server.ps1 needs to deliver CTRL_BREAK. A server
#     you cannot stop gracefully is a server that loses world state.
#  2. It REFUSES to start a second instance. Double-starting on one port
#     happened twice in a single session; the second process fails to bind and
#     lingers, and then it is unclear which one is real.
